# PLDA
plda is a parallel C++ implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) by Google. It presents a highly optimized parallel implemention of the Gibbs sampling algorithm for the training/inference of LDA. The carefully designed architecture is expected to support extensions of this algorithm.

An enhanced parallel implementation of LDA, named as PLDA+, is in beta test which can improve scalability of LDA by signiÔ¨Åcantly reducing the unparallelizable communication bottleneck and achieve good load balancing.
